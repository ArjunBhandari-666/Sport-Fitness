        <h2>Satoru Gojo is the overarching protagonist of the popular 2018 dark fantasy anime and manga series, Jujutsu Kaisen. He is the strongest Jujutsu Sorcerer in the world, even rivalling and surpassing the King of Curses Sukuna himself. Like most sorcerers, Satoru strived to protect the worldfrom the Cursed Spirits that plagued it. However, Gojo saw the structure of Jujutsu Sorcerer society as flawed, and as such hoped to change it for the better. To this end, he became a teacher at Jujutsu High, a school dedicated to the cultivation of new generations of Jujutsu Sorcerers.

        <h1>Ken kaneki</h1>
        <h2>Ken Kaneki (金木 研, Kaneki Ken) is the main protagonist of the Tokyo Ghoul series. He is currently Touka Kirishima's husband, and the father of Ichika Kaneki. Previously, he was a student who studied Japanese literature at Kamii University, living a relatively normal life. However, this quickly changed after Rize Kamishiro's kakuhou was transplanted into him and transformed him into a one-eyed ghoul. Kaneki is the first known artificial one-eyed ghoul. His unique half ghoul state is what later inspires the idea of the Quinx. After joining Anteiku as a part-time waiter, he learns how to live as a ghoul and eventually becomes known as Eyepatch (眼帯, Gantai).        </h2>
