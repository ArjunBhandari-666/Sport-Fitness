            <span class="text1">What is muscular endurance? </span>
            <span class="text2">Muscle endurance is the ability for muscles to exert force repetitively over a certain period of time. </span>
            <span class="text1">Why is muscular endurance important?</span>
            <span class="text2">Improved muscular endurance has been associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease and musculoskeletal injury, and it may even lead to changes in muscle size.             </span>

                                <li>Bend your legs and sit back until your buttocks reach the height of your knees. Your thighs should be close to parallel with the floor, and your knees should track over your toes.

                                <li>Engage your abs and curl your torso up, lifting your upper back and shoulders off the ground. Keep your elbows out to the sides rather than curling them around your head. Resist the urge to use momentum, rather than your muscles, to bring your body up. Keep a golf-ball-sized space between your chin and chest.
