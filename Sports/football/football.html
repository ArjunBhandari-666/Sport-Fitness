            <span class="text2">Football training divides into three broad but distinct branches: physical, technical and tactical. All three football training branches complement each other and are vital for the success of both the individual and the whole team.</span>
            <span class="text1">What are the three branches?</span>

                        <span class="heading">Physical Football Training</span>
                        <p id="p1">Physical training focuses on building the engine that powers you through matches. It gives you the ability to run, jump and shoot as fast and powerfully as you can. To achieve the best results from physical training, you’ll need to combine cardio training and resistance training.

                            Cardio will involve running, cycling, HIIT and the work you put in on the training ground. Resistance training involves weightlifting (compound and isolation movements) and bodyweight exercises. Beyond the training itself, you’ll need to focus on recovery, flexibility and mobility.</p>

                        <span class="heading">Technical Football Training</span>
                        <p id="p2">Technical training is about developing your technical skills on the pitch. It generally includes dribbling, passing, shooting, heading and tackling. But it can also be position-specific, particularly for goalkeepers who need to develop diving, catching and throwing skills. You can develop some skills on your own, like footwork and agility, but some skills — such as crossing and tackling — need training as a team.</p>

                        <span class="heading">Tactical Football Training</span>
                        <p id="p3">Tactical training is what makes a team stand out from the crowd. It’s the theoretical side of the game that focuses on set pieces, formations and the tactics needed for different attacking and defensive scenarios. Tactical training is usually worked on as a team and will either occur on the training ground or in a classroom environment.

                            At lower levels, tactical training will focus on your own team’s improvement and teamwork. But at the high levels, emphasis is placed on video analysis of your own squad and the opposition to find weaknesses and the best way to play against them.</p>
